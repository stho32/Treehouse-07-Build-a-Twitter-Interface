# HTML Project Template

Use the template using on Mac/Linux:

```
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/stho32/ProjectTemplate-HTML.git <your-project-dir>
cd <your-project-dir>
rm -rf .git/
git init
code .
```

You'll get a plain project structure with a basic index.html
empty files for css and js and a version of jquery and knockout.
The rest is up to you.
